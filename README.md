# CSS Box Shadow / Text Shadow tool
Just a simple tool that lets you use a color picker, slider and knob to set the position of a drop shadow effect. It should be very simple to isolate whichever elements you want and just use that. The big benefit here is the ability to convert a visual radial knob angle to the appropriate coordinates for the offset.
